# Changes
These are the changes I have made between Dub's originaly repo and my forked version. Please note they are probabaly very similar.

1. Added `JETPACK.8xp` to `master`. This version may have potentially fixed the blue flashing screen at start bug, but I'm not sure. Dub sent it to me as the version he had on his calculator and it worked on mine as well. (This is for an older version of the game. Some features are missing.)
